## üöÄ Brief Idea
The Iris dataset is a popular dataset for machine learning classification projects. It contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species - setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The goal of the project is to create a classification model that can accurately predict the species of a new iris flower based on its measurements.

In this project, I used Python and its popular machine learning libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, to perform data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.

The project will begin with loading and exploring the dataset to gain insights into the data. Then, we I processed the data by cleaning, transforming, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Next, I built several logistic regression classification model and evaluate  model's performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Finally, I used it to predict the species of new iris flowers. I also visualized the results using Matplotlib and create a user-friendly interface using Flask to deploy the model.

Overall, this project will provide a step-by-step guide on how to build a machine learning classification model using the Iris dataset, which is suitable for beginners and intermediate level machine learning enthusiasts.
